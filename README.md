# SDL-Programming

SDL Framework

This is a project I'm using to learn windows graphics programming using C++ and the SDL library (https://www.libsdl.org/).

In this project I am creating a header file (SDL_Framework.h) so I can reuse in several small projects. This framework is based on   javidx9 "One lone coder" youtube channel (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-yuWVUplUJZvieEligKBkA).
